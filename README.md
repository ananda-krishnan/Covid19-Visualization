# Covid19-Visualization
Staying at home I was constantly thinking of new ideas to work upon, that's when I thought why not take up the present situation of the world and work on it. So this is my second project on Data Analysis and Data Visualization. Here with the given available data set on the Internet I created a system which displays a chloropleth map of the world and simultaneously indicating the number of COVID-19 cases in the world.
